# Tic Tac Toe React

This is a second version of my <a href="https://github.com/diegosouza007/JogoDaVelha">other project</a> that was build using only Vanilla JS.

In this challenge I'll migrate it and use ReactJS and TypeScript for the first time and I want to add some improvements, like:

- MiniMax Algorithm (to allow user to choose different difficult modes, like: Easy, Normal, Hard and Impossible :D);
- Improvements in the UI/UX on game page;
